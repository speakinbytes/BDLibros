ANDROID DB + LISTVIEW
=====================

I use a SQLite database to manage my own model Book (Book.class). I can create, update and delete books (title, author and isbn) - DBSQLiteHelper.

I show the list of Books in an Own ListView. I use an own Adapter to manage the ListView. - AbstractAdapter and AdapterBookList.

I can filter the results in function of the title, the author or the isbn.
